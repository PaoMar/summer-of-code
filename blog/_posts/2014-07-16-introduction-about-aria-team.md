Hi everybody, we are **ARIA Team** and we want you meet us! My name is **Melissa Torregrosa**, I am 24 years old, and I’m graduate in computer Science. After my graduation I was working in the field of quality assurance and information system audit. I consider myself as an outgoing person, friendly and responsible. **Paola Garcia** is my teammate, she is 25 years old, she's from Barranquilla-Colombia and she’s graduate in computer sciences. She was working as Process Analyst. Her goal this year is to become a Ruby on Rail developer. Currently she spend her time studying and researching technology, and enjoying with her family.

We met us at the University 5 years ago and there began our friendship. **Guillermo Iguaran** is our Mentor, **Roberto Miranda** and **Laura Garcia** are our Coach. Roberto, Guillermo and we met during University and we are friends. Paola and Laura are sisters, Laura participated to the last RailsGirls Summer of Code, and through her we met the convocatory.

##About our project!

The project name is **"Improving Accessibility in Rails through ARIA"**, we choose this idea because right now people with disabilities who working development software applications have some limitations with the tools that they use. Traditional software developer tools weren’t designed with features required to be interpreted by assistive technology. 

###Our goals are:
1. To add ARIA attributes to error pages thrown by rails, so that developer with visual disabilities can identify the details of errors.

2. To add support for accessibilities attributes to the form helpers (label tag, form tag), so that developer can create web applications more easily.

3. To add ARIA attributes to Ruby on Rails official website, in order to become an accessibility website.

How you can see, we are working with ARIA attributes that's the reason for our name **"ARIA Team"**. We feel really exciting with this opportunity and hope that our project will has a positive impact in the software development progress.

_ARIA Team_.
